ManiaLib is a lightweight PHP framework for Manialink and Web developement. It 
provides a set of object-oriented libraries to help you save time on classic 
Manialink (and Web) tasks.

The library is released under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

This is the framework package
-----------------------------

This project is the framework package only. It is made to be used in other projects. If you want the full-stacked application with a demo to start building your own Manialink, check out https://github.com/maniaplanet/manialib-application-template

Installation
-----------------------------

We use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), because we're cool:

```
{
	"require": {
        "maniaplanet/manialib": "~3.1"
    }
}
```
