		* All windows are movable and we have drop down boxes, input fields and other cool ui elements!
		* Widgets positions can be changed and visibility can be toggled
		* Basic server functions are accessible by mouse using the menu
		* Full graphical administration of the server, no need to use commands, if you don't like to
		* Familiar chat commands are though available, support for nearly 90% of Fast and XAseco commands

#Menu access
		1. Use mouse and do right click anywhere at screen
		2. A menu will appear next to mouse pointer
		Type "/help" and press enter to see all available chat commands
